### Why you should hire me
- _I'm widely recognized for my exceptional ability to complete up to 15% of any programming project. My communication is top-notch—especially for those brave enough to try understanding me. I proudly specialize in not liking JavaScript and escaping into the comforting arms of strict PHP with HTML/CSS... only to end up using JavaScript anyway. Currently, I'm deep into software development with .NET and C# (Windows Forms, because why not?), but please don't expect anything beautiful from the front end. Still, I’m confident I can build something that might accidentally have a real impact on your enterprise. Maybe._

### Uhhh
- I like to think and read
- Newspaper (online because i like code)
- Cats..........
- KISS, YAGNI & SINE — whenever I’m using 100% of my brain (so... not often)
- I DO NOT LIKE ANIME.
- I DO NOT PLAY GAMES.
- Money? What's that?

### What if... 🧪 (shower thoughts & random truths)
- The universe was created with code (spoiler: it was... with math) 😧
- The AI created something faster than the light and we discovered what's inside a blackhole 🤖
- Whales could fly 🐳
- Cats. 😼
- You hire me 👻
